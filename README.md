# Household-Income-Predictor
Using R to predict the Household income in NYC based on against three key exploratory variables: respondent’s age,  Number of maintenance deficiencies of the residence, between 2002 and 2005, and finally the year the respondent moved to New York City.

I am analyzing the responses from the “New York City Housing and Vacancy Survey (NYCHVS)”, which is organized every three years in an attempt to understand the housing situation in NYC, and the interplay/effect of the four variables involved.
